## About The Project
The project is a short app that contains apis use to helps users import spreadsheets of their employees containing a date of employment, the first name, last name, gender, phone number, email address, role and
salary level of the employees.

## Setup Instructions
I went to laravel official website, clicked on the documentation and installed my laravel application to my system using the command line panel. I installed sanctum for my api and also installed laravel excel package for importing the spreadsheet given to me. I used Postman for testing the apis.

## Issues I faced while completing the project
The issues that I faced are;
i. No clear documentation.
ii. Laravel excel had serious issue when installing due to poor upgrade of dependencies of laravel X. The should stop upgrading the other versions when newer version are released.

##  Constructive feedback for improving the assignment
I have no feedback
